# Automated Text Descriptions from Imaging

**Keywords:** NLP, SemanticExplainability, MultiModalData

**Need:**  Medical imaging is still only reaching a low amount of its potential opportunity.  Image collections have large amounts of variation in both the images themselves (e.g. different machines having different angles and contrasts) and the associated reports (for the most part captured in free text).  This project would aim to explore advances in machine learning and explainability to take advantage of the relationship between these two data modalities - utilising techniques to look at automating text descriptions from images.

**Current Knowledge/Examples & Possible Techniques/Approaches:** For a wider review of explainability in medical imaging including semantic explainability, see for example - [Explainable deep learning models in medical image analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13799).

**Related Previous Internship Projects:** n/a as first year of the scheme 

**Enables Future Work:** Demonstration and deeper understanding of explainability approaches in medical imaging and working with multi-modal datasets.

**Outcome/Learning Objectives:** Open worked example and explanation of current state-of-the-art approaches to be built on, or used by others.

**Datasets:** Suitable multi-modal healthcare datasets such as MIMIC-CXR.

**Desired skill set:** When applying please highlight any experience around work with imaging or text data and specifically medical imaging data, tagging, explainability in ML, coding experience (including any coding in the open), and any other data science experience you feel relevant.
