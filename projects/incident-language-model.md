# NHS Exploring large-scale language models with NHS incident data

**Keywords:** Natural Language Processing, Healthcare Text, Dataset, Embeddings, Clustering

**Need:** NHS England and NHS Improvement collect a national repository of incident reporting data for learning.  These data are used to detect emerging patient safety incidents and understand how to build safer systems.  The real 'signals' in these data are within free-text field, but the scale of the dataset means that only a few percent can recieve a full review from clinical teams.  To make better use of these data, and drive learning from incidents that are not reviewed, applications of NLP hold promise.  The dataset has been used for topic modelling and previous word-vector model in PhD projects but these techniques are not yet in production.  The creation of an appropriate language model will allow the use of clustering and other methods to find new targets for clinical review.  This project would seek to build the first steps of a language model by applying different representations and of the text to find preferred models.

**Current Knowledge/Examples & Possible Techniques/Approaches:** Text Extraction, Processing and Curation, Evaluation and Benchmarking of different models.  Use of modern open source NLP tools and exposure to neural network frameworks such as TensorFlow or Pytorch.

**Related Previous Internship Projects:** n/a as first year of the scheme.  Possibility of architecture already put in place.

**Enables Future Work:** This work may require ongoing projects of which this will be the foundation e.g. tuning the selected language model, training on more data, development of production models, examining clusting or anomoly detection algorithms.

**Outcome/Learning Objectives:** Open source published code for training the language model, and potentially the language model itself.  The first step is to demonstrate the process on a smaller amount of data before applying to the full dataset.

**Datasets:** The National Reporting and Learning (NRLS) system - the national repository of NHS Incident reporting data, holding over 15 years of NHS data.

**Desired skill set:** When applying please highlight any experience around work with text data and specifically medical text data, natural language processing, tagging of text, coding experience (including any coding in the open), and any other data science experience you feel relevant.
