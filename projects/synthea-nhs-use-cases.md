# Adapting Synthea for NHS Use Cases

**Keywords:**  Synthetic Data, Pathways

**Need:**  The development of robust pathway analysis would enable a whole host of insights into patient experience and impact of interventions across the NHS.  Synthea<sup>TM</sup> is an open-source, synthetic patient generator that models the medical history of synthetic US patients.  This tool has the potential to support the generation of realistic synthetic patient pathways in the NHS, enabling the development of pathway analysis as well as being a rich source of test data, and a place to share clinical pathways.   This project would seek to demonstrate how Synthea can be calibrated and auto-tuned to produce NHS pathways.

**Current Knowledge/Examples & Possible Techniques/Approaches:**  Details of Synthea can be found on their Github and io site: [Synthea by the Standard Health Record Collaborative](https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea/).  The MITRE team have started to address the issue of localization of Synthea for [other areas](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki/Other-Areas) and in particular have created a [worked example for Shropshire](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea-international/blob/master/example/example.md) as a demonstration of potential.

**Related Previous Internship Projects:**  [SynPath](https://github.com/nhsx/SynPath), [Longitudinal synthetic data generation](https://nhsx.github.io/nhsx-internship-projects/synthetic-data-exploration-longitudinal/)

**Enables Future Work:**  Demonstration of the suitability of Synthea in the UK would support sharing of clinical pathways and the development of pathway analysis including impact assessment of potential interventions.

**Outcome/Learning Objectives:**
- Assessment and alignment of Synthea to UK use
- Auto-Tuning Algorithm
- Use of Synthea pathways in pathway impact analysis 

**Datasets:** n/a

**Desired skill set:**  When applying please highlight any experience around work with pathways or longitudinal data, software development, coding experience (including any coding in the open), and any other data science experience you feel relevant.
